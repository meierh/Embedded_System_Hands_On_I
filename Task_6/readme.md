## 6 Dimming a LED by PWM

**Short explanation of the schematic**:
Circuit with 5V voltage source V2, the LED, a resistor R2 and a transistor. When the voltage source V3 activates the circuit the LED lights up.

**KiCad project and screenshots of the simulation results**:

The simulated base voltage was made to fit the measured one. Obviously the simulated voltage is cleaner than the measured voltage.


**Explanation or documented implementation of improved brightness step equality**:
